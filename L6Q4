What is the advantage and disadvantage of Sorting and BinarySearch over BinarySearchTree data and heaps data Structures?
Advantages of Sorting and BinarySearch are that when the element in a sorted array needs to be searched for. If this is
case then binary search algorithm is the way to go because the search automatically eliminates half of the list from
further searching by using a recursive approach. However, when the values of an array have to be updated during
runtime w/out breaking the sorted property, then we need a BST. A BST in this case can insert and delete in O(log(n))
time while in a binary search it would take O(n). The recursive approach of a BinarySearch is its disadvantage as it
requires more stack space.
If we have to search for an element in a sorted array, then a binary search would be fastest.
